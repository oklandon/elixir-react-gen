# SiteGen

## Installation

generate a neat site.
NOTE: this is a work in progress. Need to add error handling and better dependency management.
This currently uses create-react-app. I'm working on replacing this with a more configurable webpack scaffolding.
```elixir
mix escript.build
./site_gen --name {whatever you want your app to be called}
cd {whatever you named it}
yarn start
```
